DAY 1: Exploring SSRF
Date: 2024-06-04
Room: Intro to Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) @TryHackMe

Objective:
Find the flag in the /private directory.


Steps Taken:

Account Creation:
Created a new account on the ACME IT Support website. This was necessary to gain access to the /customers/new-account-page where the SSRF vulnerability could be exploited.

Identifying the Vulnerability:
On the new account page, I found an option to choose an avatar. Each avatar choice was represented by a radio button with a value pointing to different image assets, such as /image/assetX.

Initial Attempt:
I first attempted to change the value of the avatar selection to /private, hoping it would grant access to the directory. However, this resulted in an error message: "URL cannot start with private."

Bypassing the Restriction:
To bypass this restriction, I applied a directory traversal technique. I modified the value to x/../private. This trick essentially moved one directory up and then accessed the /private directory.
This adjustment successfully bypassed the block, allowing me to retrieve the flag needed to complete the room.
You can find the flag in the flag.txt file for easy access. 

What I Learned:
Directory Traversal Basics:
I learned how directory traversal can be used to bypass access controls by manipulating file paths. This involves using special sequences like ../ to navigate through the file system, 
potentially accessing sensitive directories or files.


Reflection:

Security Implications:

Understanding directory traversal is crucial for both attacking and defending web applications. This exercise highlighted the importance of validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent unauthorized access.
I realized that even a seemingly minor oversight in input validation could lead to significant security breaches, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing and secure coding practices.

SSRF Context:
This exercise was also an introduction to SSRF, where the server is tricked into making requests to internal or external resources. It's a powerful vulnerability that, if left unchecked, 
can lead to data leaks, internal network scanning, and further exploits.

Practical Application:
By engaging in hands-on practice through TryHackMe, I gained a better understanding of the theoretical concepts and their practical applications. 
This kind of interactive learning is invaluable for reinforcing security principles and preparing for real-world scenarios.
